                <p>At Aarav, we believe in empowering you to achieve your dreams. Whether you're
                    planning to buy your first home, upgrade your vehicle, or grow your business, a
                    secured loan can help you turn those dreams into reality. By using an asset like
                    your home or car as collateral, you can access lower interest rates, higher loan
                    amounts, and flexible repayment options—all designed with you in mind.</p>

                <h2>What is a Secured Loan?</h2>
                <p>A secured loan is a loan that’s backed by something valuable you
                    own—like your home, car, or savings. By offering collateral, lenders
                    are able to give you better terms, making your financial goals more
                    affordable and achievable.</p>
